## Introduction

## Method
### Null Distribution
Three methods were chosen to create null distributions from the data
1) __Shuffle the data__
This takes all the original data points and shuffles the order in the variables to
remove correlation between the variables
2) __Max Min Uniform Distribution__
This is generated from a uniform distribution between the minumum and maximum values
of the variable
3) __PCA Distribution__
The eigan vectures of the data set are gained through PCA, these are then used to
transform a random data set generated from a  single gaussian distribution. The
resulting data set is one with only one cluster yet maintains the relationships
between the variables

### Cluster seperation metrics
Three seperation metrics are used
